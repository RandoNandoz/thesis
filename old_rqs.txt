    %  \item [\textbf{RQ1:}] How can we measure the effectiveness of various unit test carving tools?
    %      \begin{itemize}
    %          \item Look into existing tools (which we'll need to for the thesis anyways.
    %          \item How do they evaluate their work?
    %      \end{itemize}
    %  \item [\textbf{RQ2:}] What qualities make a program friendly to unit test carving?
    %      \begin{itemize}
    %          \item Known unknown...
    %      \end{itemize}
    %  \item [\textbf{RQ3:}] What code-level aspects in a program cause ExploTest to fail?
    %      \begin{itemize}
    %          \item We know a little, the existence of references to native code.
    %          \item I.e., unpickable objects
    %      \end{itemize}
    %  \item [\textbf{RQ4:}] What kinds of programs do (or do not) ExploTest work on, and why?
    %      \begin{itemize}
    %          \item Not sure the answer to this right now??
    %      \end{itemize}
    %  \item [\textbf{RQ5:}] What is the process for using ExploTest to localize faults in software?
    %      \begin{itemize}
    %          \item Do Zahin's ExploTesting away bugs strategy on all the examples
    %      \end{itemize}
    %  \item [\textbf{RQ6:}] How can we improve ExploTest to support more Python programs?
    %      \begin{itemize}
    %          \item Slicing?
    %      \end{itemize}
    %  \item [\textbf{RQ7:}] Modulo programming language, how does ExploTest differ from other existing unit
    % test carving tools?
    %      \begin{itemize}
    %          \item From Zihao's paper: vs. Fuzzing book carver
    %          \item vs. MicroTestCarver: @explore is targeted, MTC
    %              logs all methods
    %      \end{itemize}
    % \item [\textbf{RQ8:}] Do occurrences of ExploTest failures occur in code with poor testability?
    %      \begin{itemize}
    %          \item What is bad code??
    %      \end{itemize}
    %  % \item [\textbf{RQ9:}] Do occurrences of ExploTest failures occur with bugs?
    %  \item [\textbf{RQ10:}] What types of failure does ExploTest exhibit in its failure cases?
    %  \item [\textbf{RQ11:}] What amount of speedup do the tests that ExploTest provide compared to the system test?
    %      \begin{itemize}
    %          \item Inspired by Zihao's paper
    %      \end{itemize}
    %  \item [\textbf{RQ12:}] How much of a performance penalty does running ExploTest provide?
    %      \begin{itemize}
    %          \item We need a mode that works on everything
