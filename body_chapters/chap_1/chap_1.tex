ExploTest is a tool that solves software engineering problems!?
\section{Problem Statement}

Unit tests are the gold standard to test programs to catch analysis or programming errors. An ideal unit test only assesses one behaviour of the program, is repeatable and requires no software engineer intervention. They often aid in the debugging process, allowing software engineers to identify bugs faster, and earlier in the product life cycle. However, the creation of unit tests is often falsely perceived to not contribute to the product’s development. Creating these tests also requires effort to gather the inputs to the test, and requires the software engineer to create test oracles (assertions in JUnit style testing frameworks) to model correct behaviour. As programs evolve, these oracles may shift, and inputs to the test may also change.

\section{Scope of Research}
We intend to evaluate 4 research questions enumerated below:
\begin{itemize}
   %  \item [\textbf{RQ1:}] How can we measure the effectiveness of various unit test carving tools?
   %      \begin{itemize}
   %          \item Look into existing tools (which we'll need to for the thesis anyways.
   %          \item How do they evaluate their work?
   %      \end{itemize}
   %  \item [\textbf{RQ2:}] What qualities make a program friendly to unit test carving?
   %      \begin{itemize}
   %          \item Known unknown...
   %      \end{itemize}
   %  \item [\textbf{RQ3:}] What code-level aspects in a program cause ExploTest to fail?
   %      \begin{itemize}
   %          \item We know a little, the existence of references to native code.
   %          \item I.e., unpickable objects
   %      \end{itemize}
   %  \item [\textbf{RQ4:}] What kinds of programs do (or do not) ExploTest work on, and why?
   %      \begin{itemize}
   %          \item Not sure the answer to this right now??
   %      \end{itemize}
   %  \item [\textbf{RQ5:}] What is the process for using ExploTest to localize faults in software?
   %      \begin{itemize}
   %          \item Do Zahin's ExploTesting away bugs strategy on all the examples
   %      \end{itemize}
   %  \item [\textbf{RQ6:}] How can we improve ExploTest to support more Python programs?
   %      \begin{itemize}
   %          \item Slicing?
   %      \end{itemize}
   %  \item [\textbf{RQ7:}] Modulo programming language, how does ExploTest differ from other existing unit test carving tools?
   %      \begin{itemize}
   %          \item From Zihao's paper: vs. Fuzzing book carver
   %          \item vs. MicroTestCarver: @explore is targeted, MTC
   %              logs all methods
   %      \end{itemize}
   % \item [\textbf{RQ8:}] Do occurrences of ExploTest failures occur in code with poor testability?
   %      \begin{itemize}
   %          \item What is bad code??
   %      \end{itemize}
   %  % \item [\textbf{RQ9:}] Do occurrences of ExploTest failures occur with bugs?
   %  \item [\textbf{RQ10:}] What types of failure does ExploTest exhibit in its failure cases?
   %  \item [\textbf{RQ11:}] What amount of speedup do the tests that ExploTest provide compared to the system test?
   %      \begin{itemize}
   %          \item Inspired by Zihao's paper
   %      \end{itemize}
   %  \item [\textbf{RQ12:}] How much of a performance penalty does running ExploTest provide?
   %      \begin{itemize}
   %          \item We need a mode that works on everything
   %      \end{itemize}
   \item [\textbf{RQ1:}] \textbf{To what extent does the unit test carving tool we created generate viable unit tests when applied to popular, open-source Python repositories?}
   \item [\textbf{RQ2:}] \textbf{What software families and attributes are associated with the differing viabilities of unit tests created by the tool?}
   \item [\textbf{RQ3:}] \textbf{What is the amount of speedup offered by the unit tests created by the tool compared to their system test runs?}
   \item [\textbf{RQ4:}] \textbf{What modes of failure occur when the tool fails to create any kind of unit test?}
   \item [\textbf{RQ5:}] \textbf{What is the procedure to use ExploTest to catch defects in software?}
\end{itemize}
