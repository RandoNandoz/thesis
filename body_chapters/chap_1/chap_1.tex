ExploTest is a tool that solves software engineering problems!?
\section{Problem Statement}

Unit tests are the gold standard to test programs to catch analysis or programming errors. An ideal unit test
only assesses one behaviour of the
program, is repeatable and requires no software engineer intervention. They often aid in the debugging
process, allowing software engineers to
identify bugs faster, and earlier in the product life cycle. However, the creation of unit tests is often
falsely perceived to not contribute to the
product's development. Creating these tests also requires effort to gather the inputs to the test, and
requires the software engineer to create test
oracles (assertions in JUnit style testing frameworks) to model correct behaviour. As programs evolve, these
oracles may shift, and inputs to the
test may also change.

\section{Scope of Research}
We intend to evaluate 4 research questions enumerated below:
\begin{itemize}
        \item [\textbf{RQ1:}] \textbf{To what extent does the unit test carving tool we created generate viable
                      unit tests when applied to popular,
                      open-source Python repositories?}
        \item [\textbf{RQ2:}] \textbf{What software families and attributes are associated with the differing
                      viabilities of unit tests created by the tool?}
        \item [\textbf{RQ3:}] \textbf{What is the amount of speedup offered by the unit tests created by the tool
                      compared to their system test runs?}
        \item [\textbf{RQ4:}] \textbf{What modes of failure occur when the tool fails to create any kind of unit test?}
        \item [\textbf{RQ5:}] \textbf{What is the procedure to use ExploTest to catch defects in software?}
\end{itemize}
